# My Vim Configuration

This Vim configuration includes a number of useful plugins managed by
(vim-plug)[https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug]. The configuration can be
sensibly used with or without installing the plugins.

To install the configuration, run the following commands:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/beloglazov/vimrc.git
cd vimrc
./install.sh
```

Enjoy! :)
